2. **Install Dependencies:**
   - Navigate to the frontend directory (`cd frontend`) in your terminal.
   - Run `npm install` to install required packages.

## Running the Frontend

1. **Start Development Server:**
   - Run `npm start` to launch the frontend in development mode.
   - It typically starts on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Additional Notes

- Refer to the backend server READMEs for specific setup and configuration details.
- This application is intended for research and development purposes. Assess security implications before production deployments.
