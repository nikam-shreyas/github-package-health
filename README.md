# Repository Health Analysis with AI-Powered Insights

## Empowering Developers to Maintain Healthy Repositories

This application analyzes the health of Python packages within your GitHub repositories and offers AI-generated insights to guide improvement:

**Key Features:**

- **Visualized Package Health:** Scans for dependencies, displays their health status, and identifies potential vulnerabilities.
- **AI-Generated Insights:** Provides tailored suggestions for enhancing repository health, powered by Google's PALM language model.
- **Package Expert Chat:** Interact with a virtual expert (also powered by PALM) for tailored advice and guidance.
